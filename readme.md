Docker Manager
==============

This project was started to take over the Ventiv Technology Environment Manager application.  However, this one will be
more generic, and will support ANY Dockerized project.

Open Sourcing
-------------

In order to open source this project, Ventiv Technology things will have to be removed.  Currently, this is the following:

- /src/main/resources/data/env-config
- /src/main/resources/config/application-aes.properties
- Security Keys for Docker Hosts ????
